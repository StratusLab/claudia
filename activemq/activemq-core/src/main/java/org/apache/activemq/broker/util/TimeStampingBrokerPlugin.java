/**
 * A Broker interceptor which updates a JMS Client's timestamp on the message
 * with a broker timestamp. Useful when the clocks on client machines are known
 * to not be correct and you can only trust the time set on the broker machines.
 * 
 * Enabling this plugin will break JMS compliance since the timestamp that the
 * producer sees on the messages after as send() will be different from the
 * timestamp the consumer will observe when he receives the message. This plugin
 * is not enabled in the default ActiveMQ configuration.
 * 
 * 2 new attributes have been added which will allow the administrator some override control
 * over the expiration time for incoming messages:
 *
 * Attribute 'zeroExpirationOverride' can be used to apply an expiration
 * time to incoming messages with no expiration defined (messages that would never expire)
 *
 * Attribute 'ttlCeiling' can be used to apply a limit to the expiration time
